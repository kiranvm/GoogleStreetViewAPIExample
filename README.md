Project to explore Google Streetview APIs

Google Streetview image requests must include the size and location parameters.

The project adds the concatenated streetStr and cityStr values to the string: http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=600x300&location= to create a complete image request that includes the required parameters.
